# tictactoe
Goal: To create a working, 2 player tic-tac-toe game using Java, using only linear data structures 

Logic: 
- Create a 2d 3x3 string array that starts with dashes in each position
- Create a loop that alternates between the X player and O player, and allows them to input an integer that corresponds to their desired position of X/O input
- Keep printing the array after X's and O's are added
- Keep checking if the game has been won by X or O using a suitable algorithm
